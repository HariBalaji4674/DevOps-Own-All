Networking concepts:

1) Host --> the device which receives and send/transforms the traffic is called the host 
	eg:.... Laptop,server,cloud,computer etc...
	client intitiates the requests and server responds
	servers are the computers with computers installed which responds what the client reuqests for information
	file server--> the computers conatining file availble to all the users connected to a local area is called
	
	
2) IP-Address --> Internet protocol for each host (identity)
	Ipv4 and Ipv6 -->
	ip address are 32 bits --> all about is 0's and 1's 
	0000000000000001111111111111
	
	we convert those 32 bits into 8 octets 
	01010101 - 01010101-10101010-10101010
	
	we convert those 8 digits into  format Binary Numbers 
	
	the smallest binary numbers in the 8 bits is 0 and largest 8 bits binary number will be 255
	ip address will be in the combination of between 0 -255 at any number
	smallest --> 0 
	largest --> 255
	
	01000000.00000000.01100000.10100000
	    
    2^6 = 64      0       . 2^6+2^5=32+64=96     .   2^7+2^5 =32+128 == 160 
	
	64.0.96.160 --> ip Address 
	
3) Sub-Netting --> The breaking up of the ip address based on different hierarchies is called the Subnetting 
	Static IP-Address--> Ip adress having constant all the time is called static ip adress
	Dynamic IP-Address--> the adresses having changing the ip address all the time is called Dynamic Ip Address

4) Network -->  Communication between two devices each other is called the network. 
				Grouping the hosts which require the similar connectivity is called the network
	
5) Repeaters --> communication between two devices makes difficult without repeaters 
			     regenerates the signals which can make signals easily transferable

6) Hub --> Hubs are the devices simply multi-port Repeaters --> 
		which makes communication easily transfer between multiple devices ( 1 or more)
		Hubs Duplicate the Data packets and sends to all the hosts in the connection(Network)
		
		
7) Bridge --> Bridges are the device which is connected to two set of hubs on each side 
			  Bridges only have two ports --> one hub on one side and anoter hub on another side 
			  Bridges learn which host are on each side and sends data packets accordingly 
			  if the data packets sending from host one need to reach to particular hub it will send to that hub

8) Switch --> a Combination of Hubs and Bridge are called a Switch 
			  Hubs --> multi-connected ports (multi regenetors) 
			  Bridge --> learns which hosts are on each port
			  Switches contains multiple ports each having diff port number and creates a tables where communication
			  can happen between only two particular hosts
			  
9) Routers --> a device which can facilitate the communication between two different networks 
			   Provides a traffic control point(Security,Filtering,Redirecting) 
			   Router is followed through the internet.

10)Network Traffic --> Amount of data moving across a computer network at any given point of time 
						Network traffic i also called data traffic 
						Data Traffic is divided into data packets and send to receivers end
